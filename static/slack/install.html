  <h1>Welcome to Coding Challenge App</h1>
  <p>This app allows you to send coding challenges to candidates from Slack. In order to install this app please click the "Add to Slack" button you see below. You will then be redirected to the Slack web application to authorize using this app in your Slack workgroup. In order for this to work, you need to be logged in to your slack workgroup in this browser session. If you are using the Slack desktop or mobile apps, you will not be able to authorize the app, so you need to log in to Slack from your browser. </p>
