# Coding Challenge App

This app is designed to:

* Create/send coding challenges through a Github based workflow.
* Manage a pool of reviewers and their schedules to interview the candidate - Based on an assumption that the challenge reviewer will be interviewing the candidate (if all goes well) as the last step.
* Manage all of the above from Slack
